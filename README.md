# geofeed

## Purpose
This project includes self-published geofeed data for AS49752, using the format explained in [this RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8805.html).
I have also implemented these in my own subnets and aut-num as described in [this webinar from RIPE81](https://ripe81.ripe.net/presentations/27-RIPE81_geofeeds_discovery.pdf).

## contributing

Contributions are checked on a case-by-case basis. If you believe one of the locations of the subnets listed anywhere in this repository is incorrect, please open a pull request with the correct location.
